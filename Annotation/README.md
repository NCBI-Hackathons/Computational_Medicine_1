# **NAME OF PIPELINE** -- A Template for producing a polygenic risk score for the masses
### *insert link to doi or citation*
#### Intro statement 
##### Assuming there is a family in which most individuals display a particular phenotypic trait derived from a specific disease diagnosis (**add any specifications of which disease(s) we will be focusing on**), our pipeline aims to target the unresolved and provide those who are inquiring with a polygenic risk score which would demonstrate how well "protected" the individual(s) in question are from acquiring the phenotypic trait.
