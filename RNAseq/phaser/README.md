# phASER
The project aims oto look at compound heterozygots within populations. We used phASER to extract compound heterozygots from RNA-seq data. 

Data:
phASER uses two types of information genotype and expression. 
We used the phased VCF files and RNA-seq data from the E-GEUV-1 project. 

Genotype:

RNA-seq:

We build a R package (https://github.com/vjcitn/BiocRnaHap) to inspect compound heterozygots from the haplotype.txt provided by phaser.
