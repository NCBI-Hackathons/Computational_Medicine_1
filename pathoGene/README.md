#pathoGene

## What does it do?

##### This tool allows a user to take the coordinate of a structural variant (SV) and compare it to SVs in ClinVar and GNOMAD!  Once there are matches identified, a pathogenicity score is calculated based on ClinVar assertions and GNOMAD frequencies!  

``` 
It outputs a report that contains 
+ A description of the ClinVar Variant
+ An overall and population specific frequency from GNOMAD
+ The original query information 
```

## How do you use it?

##### The chromosome and position are put in on the command line.  A fuzzy matching algorithm is implemented (see the paper for more details).    

```
List of flags:
+ @erinkwagner1 will put the list of flags in here

## You're awesome.
